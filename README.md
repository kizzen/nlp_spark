# Classifying Emails as Spam using NLP and Spark

I built and evaluated NLP models that classify email messages as spam or non-spam. A Spark data pipeline (`pip install pyspark`) was used to train and evaluate these spam classifiers. Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used to perform some of the data processing steps (`pip install nltk`). I implemented the Term Frequency Inverse Data Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to transforms words into numbers.

I also built a tool that speeds up the writing process by findings repeated words using lemmatization and stemming (`python writing_tool.py`) which is run from the Terminal.
